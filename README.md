# Project Objective

The aim of this project was to establish a network configuration with the following key components:

1. **Static IP Addresses**: Configure machines with static IP addresses.
2. **Gateway Configuration**: Set up routes with gateways to connect routers and the central hub, Dumas, ensuring connectivity to servers and the internet.
3. **Static Routes for Admin and Teams**: Establish static routes between admin and team machines to enhance network efficiency.
4. **DHCP Service**: Configure DHCP services on routers Athos, Aramis, Dartagnan, and Porthos to assign IP addresses to connected machines.
5. **DNS Service**: Configure DNS using `/etc/hosts` and BIND settings on the routers to facilitate name-based access.
6. **SSH Service**: Set up SSH access with private and public keys to enable secure communication.

This project provided hands-on experience in network configuration techniques. The chosen configuration is DHCP-based, and the report details the configuration steps for each component.
