The aim of this project was to establish a network configuration with static IP addresses, set up gateways, implement static routes, configure DHCP and DNS services, and enable SSH access. This project provided hands-on experience in network configuration techniques.

##Key components of the project:

1. Configuration of Machines: The project involves configuring machines with static IP addresses, making adjustments to network interfaces.

2. Gateway Configuration: Routes with gateways are set up, connecting the project's routers and central hub, Dumas, ensuring connectivity to servers and the internet.

3. Static Routes for Admin and Teams: Static routes are established between admin and team machines, enhancing network efficiency.

4. DHCP Service: DHCP services are configured on routers Athos, Aramis, Dartagnan, and Porthos to assign IP addresses to connected machines.

5. DNS Service: DNS is configured using /etc/hosts and BIND settings on the routers, facilitating name-based access.

6. SSH Service: SSH access is set up with private and public keys, enabling secure communication.

7. The chosen configuration is DHCP-based, and the report details the configuration steps for each component.
